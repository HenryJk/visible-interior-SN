## Requirements

BepInEx 5 - latest

## Installation

Download released files and unpack it to BepInEx/plugins folder.

## Known issues

Swim charge fins and Ultra glide fins will appear very dark without
shining direct light (e.g. flashlight) upon them. The bug exist in
the original object so our best bet is to wait for the fix in vanilla.
